The provided set of programs implements a system on a microcontroller that combines multiple functionalities:
The system utilizes UART communication to exchange data with external devices or interfaces. This is facilitated by the functions defined in ‘uart.c’ and ‘uart.h’.
It incorporates timer-based functionality, for creating periodic events. This is handled by the functions defined in ‘timer.c’ and ‘timer.h’.
The system is also capable of displaying digits on a 7-segment display. This is achieved by the functions defined in ‘digit.c’ and ‘digit.h’.
The system controls the state of an LED. This functionality is implemented in timer.c.
